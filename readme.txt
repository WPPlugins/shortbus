Quickly and easily manage shortcodes.

== Description ==
Add javascript, iframes, php, flash, and other code to posts, pages, and widgets with ease.

= What are shortcodes? =
Think of shortcodes as glorified placeholder text. WordPress strips out scripts, iframes, and other code within the visual editor. To get around this limitation, you'd create a **shortcode**, which looks something like [this]. WordPress will then automatically replace [this] with the content of your choosing.

= Why use Shortcode Manager? =
The Shortcode Manager plugin provides a clean, simple interface for managing shortcodes. It even includes an import / export feature for painless migration!

= Usage =
* Add shortcodes within Tools -> Shortcodes.
* Use [sb name="My Shortcode"] within your posts or pages.

= Please support the plugin =
Your ratings and donations really make a difference!


== Installation ==

1. Upload 'shortbus' to the '/wp-content/plugins/' directory
2. Activate the plugin through the 'Plugins' menu in WordPress
3. Click on Tools -> Shortcodes to get started
